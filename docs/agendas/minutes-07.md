## Discussing what we did for week 4 and 5:
  
- Everyone seemed to have done their tasks, discussed in the previous meeting. 
- The project has progressed since last meeting.

## Current encountered issues:
- Expenses are not persisted/added in the database.
- We do not implement websockets and long polling(requirement)
- If you add something to the frontend - fxmls add an id and add them in the language 
- There are issues which should be closed
- There are unused branches 

## Non - Basic Requirements progress
- Detailed expenses: cannot be implemented yet since it requires working expenses
- Email: send invite codes is done. Send payment instructions needs to be done
- Statistics: not started yet
- Currency change: Maria is researching on it 
- Language change: seems to work but needs polishing

## Discussing next steps: 
- We should try to write more tests in general - every merge request should add to the test coverage
- Add keyboard shortcuts in README file 
- We should implement websockets in admin
- We should implement long polling for some of the endpoints in client
- Handle multiple clients at the same time 
- Connect to different server for client / on startup the user should be asked which server they want to connect
- Fix the add expense
- Think about product pitch 
- HCI - discuss style issues (error handling and icons)

## Distributing tasks:
  - Alex - Test the frontend FXML classes
  - Alexander - Create a draft product pitch, finish event overview window, check Dutch language template  
  - George - Change server url for client, add the keyboard shortcuts in README  
  - Maria - Fix the add expense
