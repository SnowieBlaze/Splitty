### Discussing what we did for week 6:

- Everyone has progressed on their respective tasks

### Current encountered issue:
- Testing controllers encountering issues related to gradle
- TestFX
- JSON import doesn't seem to work with the TA (maybe an issue with the filePath)
- Long-polling related to the EventOverview (automatically switches events on other clients)
- Issues with the file path

### Non - basic requirements progress:
- HCI: more keyboard shortcuts have been added
- UI: now most fxml files are finished, we can start on making everything look nice
