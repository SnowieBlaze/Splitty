# Points of action
*The items below are things you should look into after the first meeting. During the meeting you can divide (some of) the work between the team members, so that everybody has something to do afterwards.*

 - Things to discuss:
     - Code of Conduct (5 min)
     //The code of conduct was written to the required amount of words.
     //Everyone contributed equally in writing the code of conduct by approaching different sections.
     //Overall, our goals were aligned and we managed to create a cohesive code of conduct.
     //The different requirements should have been met.
     //All that's left is to ensure our overleaf document respects the standards(add the abstract, follow the format)
 - Check progress:
     - Template Project (5 min)
     - Git Assignment (5 min)
         - did anyone encounter issues
         //Some people did encounter issues, but managed to solve them alone.
         //One member had an issue. We will help them after addressing our entire agenda.
 - Look at the Backlog, Basic Requirements and Extras (5 min)
 //Started discussing the issue, we will create an overleaf document with an overview.
 //We are sketching and writing a diagram as we go on the whiteboard.
 //In the end, all of us managed to achieve a good understanding about what we have to do and how to achieve it as far as functionalities go.
 //We also started discussing HOW our project will look in terms of java classes objects etc in orer to assign tasks.
 - Write questions for the Client Q&A (5 min)
 //How do the first 2 parts of basic functionality as an admin work?? Are the passwords the same? Is the password random for each server instance and admins receive it?
 //Maybe we come up with questions while working on our tasks.
 - Starting to create a planning for GitLab (10 min)
	 - todo list (issues) based on Backlog
     //Wrote todo list down below

# Action points for next week (Scrum board)
*Every week you fill the Scrum board with new action points for that week. See the to do list for the items you should implement.*

//Task: create a schema for the database(2 people -> 1 conceptual, 1 person checks it, corrects and turns to logical), 
//      create the checkstyle, create a UML diagram, create an openAPI doc for admin, adding issues to git
//Maria: issues
//George: UML
//Alex: conceptual schema
//Martim: turn schema to logical
//Radoslav: openAPI
//Alex T: create checkstyle and check openAPI
//Everyone: reach 100 lines of code after George creates UML(meeting on Thursday)


# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

# Questions for the TA
*Your TA will visit you in the second half of the lab session. Note down all questions that you have so that you can ask them then.*

 - Feedback 
 //Will receive some feedback on code of conduct next few days, and 'official' feedback after deadline.
 - about meaningful MR
 //Will have to code this week
 - about Scrum process
 //Will be explained in lecture

# Question round
*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*
//We're helping our member with our issue during question round since there is nothing else to be done.

# Closing
